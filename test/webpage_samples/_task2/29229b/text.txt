Llama 3.3 better than 4o, o1

I have started myself to shift from ChatGPT models because now they have started to go out of context for no reason. 

You ask them to make a summary of what we have discussed on this chat so far and it fails to note the important points. 

And if the chat is pretty lengthy, it just dismisses and gets bizarre info out of it. 

I think I smell the commercialness of it spreading across the room. 

I have had better output from the recent Microsoft's phi-4 model compared to 4o.
